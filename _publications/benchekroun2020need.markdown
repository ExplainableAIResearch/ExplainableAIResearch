Explainable AI (XAI) is paramount in industry-grade AI; however existing
methods fail to address this necessity, in part due to a lack of
standardisation of explainability methods. The purpose of this paper is to
offer a perspective on the current state of the area of explainability, and to
provide novel definitions for Explainability and Interpretability to begin
standardising this area of research. To do so, we provide an overview of the
literature on explainability, and of the existing methods that are already
implemented. Finally, we offer a tentative taxonomy of the different
explainability methods, opening the door to future research.
