When it comes to complex machine learning models, commonly referred to as
black boxes, understanding the underlying decision making process is crucial
for domains such as healthcare and financial services, and also when it is used
in connection with safety critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. As such
interest in explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) tools and techniques has
increased in recent years. However, the effectiveness of existing xAI
frameworks, especially concerning algorithms that work with data as opposed to
images, is still an open research question. In order to address this gap, in
this paper we examine the effectiveness of the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) xAI framework, one of the most popular model
agnostic frameworks found in the literature, with a specific focus on its
performance in terms of making tabular models more interpretable. In
particular, we apply several state of the art machine learning algorithms on a
tabular dataset, and demonstrate how LIME can be used to supplement
conventional performance assessment methods. In addition, we evaluate the
understandability of the output produced by LIME both via a usability study,
involving participants who are not familiar with LIME, and its overall
usability via an assessment framework, which is derived from the International
Organisation for Standardisation 9241-11:1998 standard.
