One of the main challenges for broad adoption of deep learning based models
such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), is the lack of understanding of
their decisions. In many applications, a simpler, less capable model that can
be easily understood is favorable to a black-box model that has superior
performance. In this paper, we present an approach for designing CNNs based on
visualization of the internal activations of the model. We visualize the
model's response through attentive response maps obtained using a fractional
stride convolution technique and compare the results with known imaging
landmarks from the medical literature. We show that sufficiently deep and
capable models can be successfully trained to use the same medical landmarks a
human expert would use. Our approach allows for communicating the model
decision process well, but also offers insight towards detecting biases.
