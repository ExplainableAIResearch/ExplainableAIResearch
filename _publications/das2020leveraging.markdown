Machine learning (ML) systems across many application areas are increasingly
demonstrating performance that is beyond that of humans. In response to the
proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to
develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of
machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously
explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose
performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be
leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in
the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that
surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We
introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for
generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we
evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show
that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant
improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales
automatically generated from an AI's internal task model can be used not only
to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and
ultimately improve their task performance.
