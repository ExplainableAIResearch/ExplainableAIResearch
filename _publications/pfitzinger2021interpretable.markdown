Adoption of deep neural networks in fields such as economics or finance has
been constrained by the lack of interpretability of model outcomes. This paper
proposes a generative neural network architecture - the parameter encoder
neural network (PENN) - capable of estimating local posterior distributions for
the parameters of a regression model. The parameters fully explain predictions
in terms of the inputs and permit visualization, interpretation and inference
in the presence of complex heterogeneous effects and feature dependencies. The
use of Bayesian inference techniques offers an intuitive mechanism to
regularize local parameter estimates towards a stable solution, and to reduce
noise-fitting in settings of limited data availability. The proposed neural
network is particularly well-suited to applications in economics and finance,
where parameter inference plays an important role. An application to an asset
pricing problem demonstrates how the PENN can be used to explore nonlinear risk
dynamics in financial markets, and to compare empirical nonlinear effects to
behavior posited by financial theory.
