Machine learning is increasingly used to inform decision-making in sensitive
situations where decisions have consequential effects on individuals' lives. In
these settings, in addition to requiring models to be accurate and robust,
socially relevant values such as fairness, privacy, accountability, and
explainability play an important role for the adoption and impact of said
technologies. In this work, we focus on algorithmic recourse, which is
concerned with providing explanations and recommendations to individuals who
are unfavourably treated by automated decision-making systems. We first perform
an extensive literature review, and align the efforts of many authors by
presenting unified definitions, formulations, and solutions to recourse. Then,
we provide an overview of the prospective research directions towards which the
community may engage, challenging existing assumptions and making explicit
connections to other ethical challenges such as security, privacy, and
fairness.
