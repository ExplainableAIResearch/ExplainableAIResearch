Explainable AI (XAI) is an active research area to interpret a neural
network's decision by ensuring transparency and trust in the task-specified
learned models. Recently, perturbation-based model analysis has shown better
interpretation, but backpropagation techniques are still prevailing because of
their computational efficiency. In this work, we combine both approaches as a
hybrid visual explanation algorithm and propose an efficient interpretation
method for convolutional neural networks. Our method adaptively selects the
most critical features that mainly contribute towards a prediction to probe the
model by finding the activated features. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can reduce the execution time up to 30% while enhancing
competitive interpretability without compromising the quality of explanation
generated.
