Many Machine Learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks, have long
been criticized for being "black-boxes"-a kind of models unable to provide how
it arrive at a decision without further efforts to interpret. This problem has
raised concerns on model applications' trust, safety, nondiscrimination, and
other ethical issues. In this paper, we discuss the machine learning
interpretability of a real-world application, eXtreme Multi-label Learning
(XML), which involves learning models from annotated data with many pre-defined
labels. We propose a two-step XML approach that combines deep non-negative
autoencoder with other multi-label classifiers to tackle different data
applications with a large number of labels. Our experimental result shows that
the proposed approach is able to cope with many-label problems as well as to
provide interpretable label hierarchies and dependencies that helps us
understand how the model recognizes the existences of objects in an image.
