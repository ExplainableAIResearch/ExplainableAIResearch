Explainable AI, in the context of autonomous systems, like self driving cars,
has drawn broad interests from researchers. Recent studies have found that
providing explanations for an autonomous vehicle actions has many benefits,
e.g., increase trust and acceptance, but put little emphasis on when an
explanation is needed and how the content of explanation changes with context.
In this work, we investigate which scenarios people need explanations and how
the critical degree of explanation shifts with situations and driver types.
Through a user experiment, we ask participants to evaluate how necessary an
explanation is and measure the impact on their trust in the self driving cars
in different contexts. We also present a self driving explanation dataset with
first person explanations and associated measure of the necessity for 1103
video clips, augmenting the Berkeley Deep Drive Attention dataset.
Additionally, we propose a learning based model that predicts how necessary an
explanation for a given situation in real time, using camera data inputs. Our
research reveals that driver types and context dictates whether or not an
explanation is necessary and what is helpful for improved interaction and
understanding.
