It is not scalable for assistive robotics to have all functionalities
pre-programmed prior to user introduction. Instead, it is more realistic for
agents to perform supplemental on site learning. This opportunity to learn user
and environment particularities is especially helpful for care robots that
assist with individualized caregiver activities in residential or nursing home
environments. Many assistive robots, ranging in complexity from Roomba to
Pepper, already conduct some of their learning in the home, observable to the
user. We lack an understanding of how witnessing this learning impacts the
user. Thus, we propose to assess end-user attitudes towards the concept of
embodied robots that conduct some learning in the home as compared to robots
that are delivered fully-capable. In this virtual, between-subjects study, we
recruit end users (care-givers and care-takers) from nursing homes, and
investigate user trust in three different domains: navigation, manipulation,
and preparation. Informed by the first study where we identify agent learning
as a key factor in determining trust, we propose a second study to explore how
to modulate that trust. This second, in-person study investigates the
effectiveness of apologies, explanations of robot failure, and transparency of
learning at improving trust in embodied learning robots.
