In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a key enabling technology
for the sciences and industry. Especially through improvements in methodology,
the availability of large databases and increased computational power, today's
ML algorithms are able to achieve excellent performance (at times even
exceeding the human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep
learning models are at the forefront of this development. However, due to their
nested non-linear structure, these powerful models have been generally
considered "black boxes", not providing any information about what exactly
makes them arrive at their predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in
the medical domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the
development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep
learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This introductory
paper presents recent developments and applications in this field and makes a
plea for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice.
