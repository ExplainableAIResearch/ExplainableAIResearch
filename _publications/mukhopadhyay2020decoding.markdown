This paper investigates how working of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can
be explained through visualization in the context of machine perception of
autonomous vehicles. We visualize what type of features are extracted in
different convolution layers of CNN that helps to understand how CNN gradually
increases spatial information in every layer. Thus, it concentrates on region
of interests in every transformation. Visualizing heat map of activation helps
us to understand how CNN classifies and localizes different objects in image.
This study also helps us to reason behind low accuracy of a model helps to
increase trust on object detection module.
