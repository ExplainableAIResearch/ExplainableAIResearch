We propose a simple but strong baseline for time series classification from
scratch with deep neural networks. Our proposed baseline models are pure
end-to-end without any heavy preprocessing on the raw data or feature crafting.
The proposed Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) achieves premium performance to
other state-of-the-art approaches and our exploration of the very deep neural
networks with the ResNet structure is also competitive. The global average
pooling in our convolutional model enables the exploitation of the Class
Activation Map (CAM) to find out the contributing region in the raw data for
the specific labels. Our models provides a simple choice for the real world
application and a good starting point for the future research. An overall
analysis is provided to discuss the generalization capability of our models,
learned features, network structures and the classification semantics.
