OneClass SVM is a popular method for unsupervised anomaly detection. As many
other methods, it suffers from the black box problem: it is difficult to
justify, in an intuitive and simple manner, why the decision frontier is
identifying data points as anomalous or non anomalous. Such type of problem is
being widely addressed for supervised models. However, it is still an uncharted
area for unsupervised learning. In this paper, we evaluate several rule
extraction techniques over OneClass SVM models, as well as present alternative
designs for some of those algorithms. Together with that, we propose algorithms
to compute metrics related with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
regarding the "comprehensibility", "representativeness", "stability" and
"diversity" of the extracted rules. We evaluate our proposals with different
datasets, including real-world data coming from industry. With this, our
proposal contributes to extend XAI techniques to unsupervised machine learning
models.
