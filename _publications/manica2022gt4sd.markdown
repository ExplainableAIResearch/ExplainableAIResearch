With the growing availability of data within various scientific domains,
generative models hold enormous potential to accelerate scientific discovery at
every step of the scientific method. Perhaps their most valuable application
lies in the speeding up of what has traditionally been the slowest and most
challenging step of coming up with a hypothesis. Powerful representations are
now being learned from large volumes of data to generate novel hypotheses,
which is making a big impact on scientific discovery applications ranging from
material design to drug discovery. The GT4SD
(https://github.com/GT4SD/gt4sd-core) is an extensible open-source library that
enables scientists, developers and researchers to train and use
state-of-the-art generative models for hypothesis generation in scientific
discovery. GT4SD supports a variety of uses of generative models across
material science and drug discovery, including molecule discovery and design
based on properties related to target proteins, omic profiles, scaffold
distances, binding energies and more.
