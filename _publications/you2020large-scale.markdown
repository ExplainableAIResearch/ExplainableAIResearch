The quality and accuracy of power system models is critical for
simulation-based studies, especially for studying actual stability issues in
large-scale systems. With the deployment of wide-area monitoring systems
(WAMSs), the high-reporting-rate frequency measurement provides a trustworthy
ground truth for validating models in frequency response studies. This paper
documented an effort to check, tune, and validate the U.S. power system model
based on a WAMS called FNET/GridEye. Four metrics are used to quantitatively
compare the simulation results and the actual measurement, including frequency
nadir, RoCoF, settling frequency and settling time. After tuning governor
deadband and the governor ratio, the model frequency response shows significant
improvement and matches well with the event measurement data. This work serves
as an example for tuning and validating large-scale power system models.
