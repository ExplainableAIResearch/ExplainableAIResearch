The social implications of algorithmic decision-making in sensitive contexts
have generated lively debates among multiple stakeholders, such as moral and
political philosophers, computer scientists, and the public. Yet, the lack of a
common language and a conceptual framework for an appropriate bridging of the
moral, technical, and political aspects of the debate prevents the discussion
to be as effective as it can be. Social scientists and psychologists are
contributing to this debate by gathering a wealth of empirical data, yet a
philosophical analysis of the social implications of algorithmic
decision-making remains comparatively impoverished. In attempting to address
this lacuna, this paper argues that a hierarchy of different types of
explanations for why and how an algorithmic decision outcome is achieved can
establish the relevant connection between the moral and technical aspects of
algorithmic decision-making. In particular, I offer a multi-faceted conceptual
framework for the explanations and the interpretations of algorithmic
decisions, and I claim that this framework can lay the groundwork for a focused
discussion among multiple stakeholders about the social implications of
algorithmic decision-making, as well as AI governance and ethics more
generally.
