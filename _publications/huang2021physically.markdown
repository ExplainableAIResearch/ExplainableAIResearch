Integrating the special electromagnetic characteristics of Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) in deep neural networks is essential in order to enhance the
explainability and physics awareness of deep learning. In this paper, we first
propose a novel physically explainable convolutional neural network for SAR
image classification, namely physics guided and injected learning (PGIL). It
comprises three parts: (1) explainable models (XM) to provide prior physics
knowledge, (2) physics guided network (PGN) to encode the knowledge into
physics-aware features, and (3) physics injected network (PIN) to adaptively
introduce the physics-aware features into classification pipeline for label
prediction. A hybrid Image-Physics SAR dataset format is proposed for
evaluation, with both Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 SAR data being experimented. The
results show that the proposed PGIL substantially improve the classification
performance in case of limited labeled data compared with the counterpart
data-driven CNN and other pre-training methods. Additionally, the physics
explanations are discussed to indicate the interpretability and the physical
consistency preserved in the predictions. We deem the proposed method would
promote the development of physically explainable deep learning in SAR image
interpretation field.
