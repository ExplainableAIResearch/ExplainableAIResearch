Artificial intelligence, particularly through recent advancements in deep
learning, has achieved exceptional performances in many tasks in fields such as
natural language processing and computer vision. In addition to desirable
evaluation metrics, a high level of interpretability is often required for
these models to be reliably utilized. Therefore, explanations that offer
insight into the process by which a model maps its inputs onto its outputs are
much sought-after. Unfortunately, current black box nature of machine learning
models is still an unresolved issue and this very nature prevents researchers
from learning and providing explicative descriptions for a model's behavior and
final predictions. In this work, we propose a novel framework utilizing
Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning that can provide global explanations
for decisions made by a Reinforcement Learning model and capture intuitive
tendencies that the model follows by summarizing the model's decision-making
process.
